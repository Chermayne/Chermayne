        <p><span>Hello!</span> Iâ€™m Chermayne Hiew.</p>
        <p>I grew up in a suburb in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia" target="_blank">Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</a> but have lived most of my adult life in the UK, having spent time in Bristol, London, Cambridge, Thame, High Wycombe, and Wickham. </p>
        <p>I am interested in the interconnectivity of things. The spaces that are shared.</p>
        <p>I have a degree in Sociology as I thought that was the route that would directly lead me to make great positive changes in our society. But on this route I've learnt that change is extremely difficult to enact and extremely slow to happen. Humans don't act the way we want them to, plans don't go the way we envision them to, and nature doesn't respond the way we expect her to.</p>
        <p>So instead of a straight path, my life has taken turns and detours through various industries, various roles, and various passions. However, with no regrets whatsoever, as I now know through experience that life and learning is not linear. Life events derail people from life goals and priorities change throughout one's lifetime.</p>
        <p>I have worked in market research as a mid-level manager, leading a team and specialising in managing and developing the company's digital products. I have worked in several start up non-profit organisations that worked with the community and nature. I have explored web development and design. I have worked on several farms, and I have started a market garden business that sells to shops and restaurants in the local area and in London, while in partnership with a local SEND school to integrate nature learning into their curriculum.</p> 
        <p>Through each experience, and each iteration, I patch myself with more wisdom, more knowledge, more experience, and more courage.</p>
        <p>Anyway, that's a brief look into my life so far. As for this site, it is the first I've built from scratch, so please leave feedback if you spot something that doesn't work as it should, and suggestions are very much welcomed, whether it'd be in code, design, or user experience.</p> 
        <p>The code is written by me but design of the site has been inspired by <a href="http://juerglehni.com/" target="_blank">http://juerglehni.com</a> and <a href="https://harvardfilmarchive.org/" target="_blank">https://harvardfilmarchive.org</a>.</p>
